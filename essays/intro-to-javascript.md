​​Although it has only been a week since the start of the Fall 2022 semester, I feel like it has already lasted an eternity. So much knowledge was crammed into my brain that I have not had the time to process all of this new information. That was especially the case for this ICS 314 class where we spent the last week learning JavaScript and ES6. As a complete newbie, this past week was pretty rough, but I would like to share with you my progress so far.

## My History
I first developed an interest in programming through AP Computer Science during my Junior year at Moanalua High School. The class, which was in Java, was my first experience with programming and I really enjoyed it. Although we only went over the basics, I felt like I could really see myself doing this as a career. Fast forwarding four years to the present, I can only say that I was too naive. 

Despite these past few years as a college student being really fun, there have also been many ups and downs. It has opened my eyes to the reality that learning to code is a difficult and time consuming process. As a freshman, learning C and C++ in EE 205 took many hours and frustrated attempts at getting programs to work. This class was also my first real introduction to the concept of object-oriented programming which forced me to develop an entirely new perspective of thinking. Later courses like EE 367 which focused on Data Structures and Algorithms in C have led me to where I am now.

## My JavaScript Learning Experience
My first impression of JavaScript was that it was pretty similar to C and C++. A lot of the syntax such as the function and variable declarations were nearly the same but with minor revisions. However, there were many new things I learned as well.

The first major difference I noticed was that JavaScript is very lax with variables compared to C and C++. Using var, let, and const to declare variables no matter whether they were a string, number, or even an array was a new experience. This took some time getting used to and I still catch myself typing int = something especially on those practice WODs. Having the concept of first-class functions where you could return a string or an integer was also something I felt was weird but cool.

Another major difference I noticed was that JavaScript is more intuitive compared to my previous languages, especially with all of the built in array functions. I appreciate that printing something to the console is a lot easier without having to memorize the formatting of different variable types. I also appreciate having useful array functions like shift(), push(), and even the array.length parameter. 

With these sort of differences, I think JavaScript is much more suited to software engineering than something like C or C++. Although I have a limited understanding of software engineering in general, I feel like the ease of creating software with JavaScript might even outweight the efficiency of C and C++ for some tasks. I would definitely need to learn more about both JavaScript and software engineering in order to form a more concrete opinion on this subject.

## Course Organization
The organization of this class is much different from my previous programming courses. Since I don't have much experience with athletic programming, I am not able to elaborate on the differences yet, but I do think that the WODs are a really good idea. Being nervous under a time constraint is something I could never get rid of and perhaps through the WODs, I might be able to become more comfortable. I was definitely stressed out during the practice WOD we had during class on Tuesday, but in the future, my goal is to be comfortable enough that I start enjoying it. I think that as long as I keep up with the course material, then this might be a really good method of learning for me.
