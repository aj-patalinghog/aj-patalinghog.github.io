## Background 

During the Fall 2022 semester, I worked as one of the Teaching Assistants for EE 160 - Programming for Engineers. Each of us were in charge of teaching different lab sections where students learned Python through an online [zyBooks](https://www.zybooks.com/catalog/programming-in-python-3/) course. As teaching Asisstants, we also had to input the grades of zyBook assignments into Google Classroom. This was a very tedious and painful process considering that there were almost 100 students in the class. One of the other Teaching Assistants then introduced me to the Google Apps Script service which would allow us to automate inputting grades. When I learned it was using JavaScript, I decided to apply what I had been learning in my ICS 314 class for the last month.


## What I Learned

I worked as a math tutor at the Learning Emporium from January 2021 until August 2022 and tutored courses ranging from Trigonometry to Calculus IV. Through this opportunity, I was able to interact with other college students who come from various different backgrounds. Oftentimes, teaching a math concept one way would work for one student but not another. This forced me to re-examine the material and to really understand it in order to explain concepts in multiple different ways. Teaching a variety of students allowed me to learn different teaching strategies and to develop my communication skills.
