## The NSA Codebreaker Challenge

The [NSA Codebreaker Challenge](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home) is an annual event hosted by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Students spend a few months working on a set of mission tasks that involve different aspects of cybersecurity and reverse engineering. With a total of 10 tasks, each being progressively more difficult, students are provided a hands-on opportunity to develop crucial skills needed by careers in the intelligence community. 

The 2021 Codebreaker Challenge involved a scenario where a suspcious IP address was identified as part of an unknown actor's infrastructure. The NSA believed that it was a listening post (LP), an attacker-controlled server that communicates with the attacker's malware. Students were asked to solve a series of tasks with themes like identifying the scope of the compromise, analyzing the malcious malware, and gaining access to the actor's infrastructure. 

## My Experience
The NSA Codebreaker Challenge was my introduction to cybersecurity and reverse engineering. Although I only managed to make it to task 7, there were many skills and tools which I needed to learn in order to complete the different tasks. For example, during task 1 we learned about networking and used Wireshark to identify the suspicious IP address associated with the LP. Tasks 2 and 3 involved tracing the source of the compromise through logs and emails. By task 4, we also pin-pointed the compromised machine through a registry hive and learning about PuTTY public and private key encrytion. Finally tasks 5 and 6 involved analyzing the malicious malware and identifying how it was hidden in plain sight. Task 7, which I did not complete, was the beginning of reverse engineering the malware where we used two methods, static analysis with Ghidra and dynamic analysis with gdb. Overall, I really enjoyed the experience and would definitely consider participating again.
