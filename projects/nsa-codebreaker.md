## What is the NSA Codebreaker Challenge?

The [NSA Codebreaker Challenge](https://nsa-codebreaker.org/home) is an annual event hosted by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). It provides students with a hands-on opportunity to develop their reverse engineering and low level code analysis skills while working on a realistic problem set centered around the NSA's mission. 

Reverse engineering is a crucial skill for those involved in the fight against malware, advanced persistent threats, and similar malicious cyber activities. As the organization tasked with protecting U.S. government national security information systems, NSA is looking to develop these skills in university students and prospective future employees.
