## What is the Learning Emporium?

[Learning Emporium](https://natsci.manoa.hawaii.edu/learningemporium/) is a tutoring resource run by the College of Natural Sciences at UH Manoa. It is a resource center for mathematics, chemistry, information & computer sciences, and physics. Students can join a community of learners and engage in conversations to strengthen their knowledge and understanding of material covered during classes. The Learning Emporium is staffed by undergraduate and graduate tutors, as well as volunteer faculty. They offer in person and online support to students looking for help with class assignments and studying.


## What I Learned

I worked as a math tutor at the Learning Emporium from January 2021 until August 2022 and tutored courses ranging from Trigonometry to Calculus IV. Through this opportunity, I was able to interact with other college students who come from various different backgrounds. Oftentimes, teaching a math concept one way would work for one student but not another. This forced me to re-examine the material and to really understand it in order to explain concepts in multiple different ways. Teaching a variety of students allowed me to learn different teaching strategies and to develop my communication skills.
