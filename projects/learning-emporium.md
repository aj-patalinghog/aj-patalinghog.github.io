## What is the Learning Emporium?

[Learning Emporium](https://natsci.manoa.hawaii.edu/learningemporium/) is a tutoring resource run by the College of Natural Sciences at UH Manoa. It is a one-stop resource center for introductory study in the fields of mathematics, chemistry, information & computer sciences, and physics. We encourage students to study and complete their class assignments in the Emporium, where assistance is readily available.

The Learning Emporium is staffed by undergraduate and graduate tutors and volunteer faculty. As a student, you can join our community of learners and engage in conversations to strengthen your knowledge and understanding of the material covered in the your classes.

## What I Learned

I worked as a math tutor at the Learning Emporium from January 2021 until August 2022. Through this opportunity, I was able to interact with other fellow college students who come from various different backgrounds. I taught math courses ranging from Trigonometry up to Calculus IV, as well as everything in between. Teaching a variety of students allowed me to learn different teaching strategies and to develop my communication skills. Often times, teaching a math concept in one way would work for one student but not another, which forced me to re-examine the material and really understand it in order to explain in multiple different ways.
